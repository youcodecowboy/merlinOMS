   - [ ] Monitor memory usage

Would you like to:
1. Complete the testing coverage?
2. Update the documentation?
3. Return to the roadmap?

The SKU Service improvements are now substantially complete. We could return to the roadmap if you feel the testing and documentation can be addressed as part of the broader implementation plan.
