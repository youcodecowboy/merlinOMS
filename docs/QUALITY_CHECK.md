- [ ] Creates order with two items of different SKUs
- [ ] First item gets exact match to stock item
- [ ] Second item gets universal match to stock item
- [ ] Both items create appropriate wash requests
- [ ] System prioritizes exact matches over universal matches
- [ ] System maintains consistency across mixed assignments

## Summary
All test scenarios have passed successfully, demonstrating:
1. Correct handling of exact SKU matches
2. Universal SKU matching functionality
3. Production item commitment and activation
4. Complete production flow from pattern to wash request

The system correctly maintains:
- Item status transitions
- Request status updates
- Metadata preservation
- Item-request linkages
- Order-item assignments
- Wash request generation

## Wash Bins

The system maintains four persistent wash bins:
- STARDUST
- INDIGO
- ONYX
- JAGGER

Each bin:
- Has a fixed capacity of 100 items
- Shows current item count and available spaces
- Displays a capacity warning when full
- Lists all items currently in the bin with their status

### Tested Scenarios

1. **Wash Request Flow**
   - Create order with specific wash type
   - Assign inventory item to order
   - Create wash request
   - Complete wash request
   - Verify item appears in correct wash bin
   - Verify item status updates to "WASH • COMPLETED"
   - Verify added timestamp is recorded

2. **Bin Capacity Management**
   - Each bin shows current capacity usage
   - Displays warning when approaching capacity
   - Shows "FULL" status when at capacity

3. **Item Tracking**
   - Items are automatically sorted into correct bins based on location
   - Each item shows:
     - SKU
     - Current status
     - Time added to bin
     - Available actions

### Validation Points

For each wash type (STARDUST, INDIGO, ONYX, JAGGER):
- [x] Order creation with specific wash type
- [x] Inventory item assignment
- [x] Wash request creation and completion
- [x] Item appears in correct bin
- [x] Status updates correctly
- [x] Timestamps are recorded
- [x] Capacity tracking works

### Error Handling

- Empty bins show "No items in bin" message
- Invalid locations are prevented
- Capacity limits are enforced
- Item status changes are tracked

# Quality Control Documentation

## Storage Bin Assignment Logic

### Overview
The system implements an intelligent bin assignment strategy for items coming from production. When an item needs to be stored, it follows a hierarchical approach to find the most appropriate storage location.

### Bin Types
1. **SKU-Specific Bins**
   - Dedicated to storing specific SKUs
   - Typically have smaller capacity (50 items)
   - Located in Zone A
   - SKU field matches exact item SKU

2. **General Storage Bins**
   - Accept any SKU
   - Larger capacity (100 items)
   - Located in Zone B
   - SKU field uses GENERAL prefix

### Assignment Algorithm
1. First attempts to find a SKU-specific bin that:
   - Matches the item's exact SKU
   - Has available capacity
   - Is active
   - Is of type 'STORAGE'

2. If no SKU-specific bin is available or suitable, falls back to general storage bins that:
   - Have available capacity
   - Are active
   - Are of type 'STORAGE'
   - Have a GENERAL prefix in SKU field

### Move Request Workflow
1. **Item Creation**
   - Item is created with initial status1='PRODUCTION'
   - Location is set to 'PRODUCTION'
   - QR code is generated

2. **Bin Assignment**
   - System searches for available bins using above algorithm
   - Selected bin must have current_count < capacity

3. **Move Request Creation**
   - Type: 'MOVE'
   - Status: Initially 'PENDING'
   - Metadata includes:
     - source: 'PRODUCTION'
     - destination: Selected bin code
     - notes: Purpose of move

4. **Move Completion**
   - Updates request status to 'COMPLETED'
   - Updates item:
     - location: Set to bin code
     - bin_id: Linked to destination bin
     - status1: Changed to 'STOCK'
     - status2: Set to 'UNCOMMITTED'
     - metadata: Tracks move history
   - Increments bin's current_count
   - Creates bin history entry

### Quality Checks
- ✅ Bin capacity is enforced
- ✅ SKU-specific bins take precedence
- ✅ General bins serve as fallback
- ✅ Move history is tracked
- ✅ Bin counts are maintained
- ✅ Item status transitions are recorded

### Test Scenarios
1. **Bin Initialization**
   - Creates both SKU-specific and general bins
   - Ensures unique SKUs
   - Sets appropriate capacities
   - Assigns correct zones

2. **Move Request Flow**
   - Creates test item
   - Finds appropriate bin
   - Creates and completes move request
   - Updates all relevant records

### Error Handling
- Validates bin availability
- Checks bin capacity before assignment
- Maintains data integrity through transactions
- Provides detailed error messages

### Future Considerations
- Implement bin optimization strategies
- Add priority zones
- Consider distance/accessibility in bin selection
- Add support for bulk moves
