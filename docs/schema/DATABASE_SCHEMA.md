# Comprehensive Database Schema Documentation

## Overview
This document provides a detailed overview of the database schema, its underlying ideology, and guidelines for future development to ensure consistency and alignment. The schema is designed to support complex SKU management, location hierarchies, and order processing while maintaining data integrity, scalability, and audit capabilities.

## Database Ideology
The database schema is built on the following core principles:

1. **Data Integrity**: Ensuring accuracy and consistency of data through constraints, validations, and normalization.
2. **Scalability**: Designing tables and relationships to handle growth in data volume and complexity without performance degradation.
3. **Auditability**: Implementing mechanisms to track changes and maintain historical records for accountability and compliance.
4. **Efficiency**: Structuring data to facilitate fast and efficient retrieval, minimizing redundancy and optimizing query performance.
5. **Flexibility**: Allowing for easy adaptation to evolving business requirements and integration with other systems.

## Core Tables

### Locations
- **Purpose**: Manage hierarchical location data, supporting complex geographical and organizational structures.
- **Key Fields**: `location_id`, `parent_location_id`, `location_name`, `location_type`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
- **Relationships**: Self-referential relationship to support hierarchy (e.g., country > state > city).
- **Indexes and Constraints**:
  - Primary Key: `location_id`
  - Foreign Key: `parent_location_id` references `location_id`
  - Index on `location_name` for quick lookup

### SKUs
- **Purpose**: Handle stock keeping units (SKUs) with attributes and transformations.
- **Key Fields**: `sku_id`, `sku_name`, `description`, `category_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
- **Relationships**: Linked to categories and inventory tables.
- **Indexes and Constraints**:
  - Primary Key: `sku_id`
  - Foreign Key: `category_id` references `Categories.category_id`
  - Unique Index on `sku_name` to prevent duplicates

### Orders
- **Purpose**: Process and track customer orders from initiation to fulfillment.
- **Key Fields**: `order_id`, `customer_id`, `order_date`, `status`, `total_amount`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
- **Relationships**: Connected to customers, order items, and payment tables.
- **Indexes and Constraints**:
  - Primary Key: `order_id`
  - Foreign Key: `customer_id` references `Customers.customer_id`
  - Index on `order_date` for efficient date range queries

### Categories
- **Purpose**: Classify SKUs into different categories for better organization and retrieval.
- **Key Fields**: `category_id`, `category_name`, `description`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
- **Relationships**: Linked to SKUs.
- **Indexes and Constraints**:
  - Primary Key: `category_id`
  - Unique Index on `category_name`

### Inventory
- **Purpose**: Track stock levels of SKUs across different locations.
- **Key Fields**: `inventory_id`, `sku_id`, `location_id`, `quantity`, `last_updated`
- **Relationships**: Linked to SKUs and locations.
- **Indexes and Constraints**:
  - Primary Key: `inventory_id`
  - Foreign Keys: `sku_id` references `SKUs.sku_id`, `location_id` references `Locations.location_id`
  - Index on `quantity` for stock level checks

### Order Items
- **Purpose**: Detail the items included in each order.
- **Key Fields**: `order_item_id`, `order_id`, `sku_id`, `quantity`, `price`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
- **Relationships**: Linked to orders and SKUs.
- **Indexes and Constraints**:
  - Primary Key: `order_item_id`
  - Foreign Keys: `order_id` references `Orders.order_id`, `sku_id` references `SKUs.sku_id`

### Payments
- **Purpose**: Record payment transactions related to orders.
- **Key Fields**: `payment_id`, `order_id`, `amount`, `payment_date`, `payment_method`, `status`
- **Relationships**: Linked to orders.
- **Indexes and Constraints**:
  - Primary Key: `payment_id`
  - Foreign Key: `order_id` references `Orders.order_id`
  - Index on `payment_date` for transaction history queries

### Customers
- **Purpose**: Store customer information for order processing and tracking.
- **Key Fields**: `customer_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `phone`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
- **Relationships**: Linked to orders.
- **Indexes and Constraints**:
  - Primary Key: `customer_id`
  - Unique Index on `email` to ensure unique customer accounts

## Guidelines for Future Development

1. **Adherence to Standards**: Follow established standards for naming conventions, data types, and indexing as outlined in `docs/standards/`.
2. **Schema Evolution**: Use version control for schema changes, documenting each change in `docs/stages/` to track evolution and ensure backward compatibility.
3. **Testing and Validation**: Implement rigorous testing for schema changes, including unit tests and integration tests, to validate data integrity and performance.
4. **Documentation**: Update this document and related documentation with every schema change to maintain an accurate and comprehensive record.
5. **Collaboration**: Engage with stakeholders across departments to ensure schema changes align with business needs and do not disrupt existing processes.

## Conclusion
This document serves as a guide for understanding the current database schema and provides a framework for future development. By adhering to the outlined principles and guidelines, we can ensure the database remains robust, scalable, and aligned with business objectives.
